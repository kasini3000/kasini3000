A certain official said: "you did not release a line of code, but first released a strict custom license.Are you crazy? "
 
My answer is:
 
1 It&apos;s not surprising that you have to agree to the agreement before you give you something.Most software requires agreement prior to installation.
 
2 It&apos;s no surprise that software protocols are strict, even harsh.For example: the protocol of face changing software "Zao".
 
3 There are a lot of harsh custom licenses, which are very common, but you have to accept them.For example, "intermediary rental contract.".
 
4 My agreement is neither strict nor strict.
